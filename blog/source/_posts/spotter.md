"Spotter" is a simple Ionic based app I've been developing over the course of the 2017 semester for many reasons, mainly to learn JavaScript. In short, the idea of this app is to help the user to track his or her workout progress. The motive behind it was to make it as easy as possible for the user to start the training with little to none configuration.

"Spotter" is a simple Ionic based app I have been developing over the 2017 semester for many reasons. First and foremost,

I wanted to improve my coding and gain some more experience in this field. At that time I felt my knowledge of JavaScript was plainly said terrible and I decided it was the time to do something about it. Another reason was that I wanted to implement some ideas that left over from my last project at my university, which were simply scratched because of time constraints and not enough experience with the framework. And last but not least I wanted to learn something new. And in my opinion, this project was not a complete waste of time.

#Basic Idea#
In short, the idea of this app is to help the user to track his or her weight lifting progress. The motive behind it was to make it as easy as possible for the user to start the training with little to no configuration.

#Current status#
As far as I am pleased with the progress that I made within a month in a completely for me new environment, there is still a lot of work to be done. There are so many features that I want to implement. And with the new semester coming up, there is not much room for any side projects. However, I still plan to work on it further if the time allows it since I feel guilty if I leave things unfinished.
